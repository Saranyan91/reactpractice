//Objectives for Funtional Components practice 
// 1. Setup the basic React Code from Scratch 
// 2. Create a Fucntional component called MyInfo that return the following UI:
    // a. An H1 with your name 
    // b. A paragraph with a little blurb about yourself
    // c. An ordered or Unordered list of the top 3 vacation spots you'd like to visit 
// 3. Render an instance of that functional component to the browser 
// Extra Challenge: learn on your own (Google!) how you can add some style to your page.
