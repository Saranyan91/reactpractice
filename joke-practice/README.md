Module 20. Props and Styling Practice 


Exercise given 

One LAST time in this course, setup a React app from Scratch 
Render an <App/> component 
App should be in its own file 
App should render 5 <Joke /> Components

Each Joke should receive a "question" prop and a "punchline" prop 
and render those however you'd like 


EXTRA CREDIT: 
Some jokes are only a punch line with no question:
E.g.: "It's hard to explain puns to kleptomaniacs because they always take things literally."

If you don't pass in a "question" prop, how might you make it only show the punchline instead?

Spend time practicing the style of your Joke component

22.Mapping Components Practice 
Given a list of products( as an array of Objects, as seen in productsData.js)
render a <Product /> component(which you'll also need to create) for each product in the list.

Make sure to use the array's `.map()` method to create these components, and don't forget to pass a `key` prop to it to avoid the warning
