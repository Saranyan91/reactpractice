Module 20. Props and Styling Practice 


Exercise given 

One LAST time in this course, setup a React app from Scratch 
Render an <App/> component 
App should be in its own file 
App should render 5 <Joke /> Components

Each Joke should receive a "question" prop and a "punchline" prop 
and render those however you'd like 


EXTRA CREDIT: 
Some jokes are only a punch line with no question:
E.g.: "It's hard to explain puns to kleptomaniacs because they always take things literally."

If you don't pass in a "question" prop, how might you make it only show the punchline instead?

Spend time practicing the style of your Joke component
